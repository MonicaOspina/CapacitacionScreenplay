	As a web user
  I want to use google translate
  To translate words between different languages

  
  Scenario: translate from english to spanish
    Given that Susan wants to transalte a word//precondition//precondiciones
    When  she translates the word cheese from English to Spanish//action
    Then she should see the word queso in the screen
